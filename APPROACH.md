## Approach & Tools

**What I Built:**  
A responsive **Resume Editor** built with React that allows users to create, edit, and preview resumes in real time, with PDF export functionality. Fully responsive for desktop and mobile.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
- React  
- Tailwind CSS  
- jsPDF & html2canvas  
- React Icons  
- Vite (fast dev server and build)

**Key Technical Decisions:**  
- Client-side PDF generation for privacy and fast performance.  
- Mobile-specific fixes for correct PDF capture and icon alignment.  
- Stateless structure using React `useState` for easy future backend integration.

**What Iâ€™d Improve if Given More Time:**  
- Add user authentication to save resumes per account.  
- Implement drag-and-drop section ordering.  
- Allow users to choose from multiple resume templates.  
- Add rich text formatting and custom styling options.  
- Integrate a backend for storing and verifying certificates and experience data.
